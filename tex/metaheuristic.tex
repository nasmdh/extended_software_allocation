\section{Metaheuristic Approach}
Although the proposed ILP approach provides exact solutions, that is with an AUTOSAR software allocation with minimum power consumption, the approach approach does not scale well for large applications. Thus, in this section, we propose an approximation approach based on several metaheuristic techniques to address the scalability challenge. Metaheuristic techniques assumes little of the problem in question, and therefore are ideal to solve high dimensional and complex optimization problems, that is, problems that are difficult or practically impossible to solve by exact methods, e.g., linear programming, or heuristic techniques, e.g., local search algorithms. They have improved over the last decades with respect to effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of use by providing fewer user-configurable parameters. Metaheuristic techniques do not guarantee optimal solutions, nevertheless, the returned solutions can be good enough (or acceptable) in the eyes of the system designer, for this particular problem, it means although the power consumption of the system is not optimal, the solution can be deemed acceptable, that is as long as the the constraints are fulfilled. In the opposite case, where the constraints could not be fulfilled, the algorithms can be rerun several times until the desired results are found, or the design can be relaxed by weakening the timing and reliability constraints of the system.

Metaheuristic techniques perform differently for different problem types, size, and complexity. In this section, we show application of different metaheuristic techniques that employ swarm intelligence and evolutionary approaches in finding the (near) optimal solutions. Specifically, we apply the Particle Swarm Intelligent (PSO), Differential Evolution techniques primarily, and further hybrid PSO with DE and Hill-climbing for improved performance. PSO has been applied to solve a wide range of problems, including a task allocation problem \cite{yin2007task}, and DE is shown to scale well for problems with high dimensions. In fact, PSO and DE are used together for improved performance in several optimization problems, likewise, PSO is used with local search techniques such as Hill climbing to intensify the search. Finally, we evaluate the different metaheuristic methods based on solution quality and allocation (or computation) time for different software allocation problems.

\subsection{Solution Representation}
In contrast to the \textit{0-1} representation, the integer-linear representation uses much lower number of variables, that is $N*K(L-1)$, e.g., for a software allocation problem with $N=10,L=8,K=2$, 140 variables are saved. Of course the possible values in the former representation is two whereas in the latter representation, it is $L$, which is usually higher and results larger solution space. Nevertheless, the integer-linear representation is compact and computationally more efficient.

\subsection{Fitness Function Definition}
% Define the fitness function
Since a metaheuristic method functions over the meta of a problem, the quality of candidate solutions is evaluated based on their fitness to meet the problem's objective. A solution that delivers lower power consumption and violates less constraints is indicated by a lower fitness value. The fitness function $f(\textbf{x})$ combines the original objective function $P(\textbf{x})$ and the constraints $Timing(\textbf{x}),Reliability(\textbf{x})$ in order to compute real-valued numbers that indicate quality of the candidate solutions.

Consequently, the original constrained optimization problem is transformed into unconstrained optimization problem, by extending the objective function $P(\textbf{x})$ with the constrains, represented by a \textit{penalty function} $\Phi(\textbf{x})$. The function returns 0 if no constrains are violated otherwise returns a positive number, essentially to penalize the candidate solution by increasing its fitness (for our minimization problem), thus discriminating the solution. The function is a combination of $\beta\sum{g_i(\textbf{x})}$ and $\gamma h(\textbf{x})$ functions, respectively computes the timing violations and a software application reliability violation, and each function is weighted to indicate the size of the penalty separately. Moreover, the penalty function $\Phi({\textbf{x}})$ is weighted to indicate the size of penalty that imposed on the combined violations of timing and reliability. \textbf{How to compute the parameters [Hamid]}
\begin{align}
\label{}
    \min_{\textbf{x}\in X}\;\;& f(\textbf{x})=P(\textbf{x}) + \alpha \Phi(\textbf{x})\\
    \label{eqn_penalityfunc}\Phi(\textbf{x}) &= \sum\phi_i(\textbf{x})
\end{align}

\subsection{Metaheuristic Algorithms}
\subsubsection{Particle Swarm Optimization}
% What is PSO
PSO is a population-based technique proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995 to study social behavior, as inspired by natural swarm intelligence observed from the flocking of birds and schooling of fishes \cite{Kennedy1995ParticleOptimization}. Since then, it is extended in order to address various metaheuristic optimization challenges, such as intensification, diversification, convergence analysis, local optima, parameter tuning, computation time, etc. It is successfully applied on several complex real-world problems, e.g., diagnosis and classification of diseases, efficient engineering designs, tuning control design parameters, scheduling problems, etc \cite{Poli2008AnApplications}. 

In PSO, the population (or swarm) $PN=\{p_1,p_2,â€¦,p_N\}$ is a collection of particles $p_i\in PN$, organized according to a certain population topology \cite{Liu2016TopologyOptimization}. A particle has a position $\textbf{x}$ and a velocity $\textbf{v}$, which denote current location and direction of the particle's motion, and current momentum, respectively. It is a memory-based technique, that is, it remembers the best performance of every particle as well as the best performance of the swarm $\textbf{z}$ in order to plan for the next move of the particles, where $\textbf{y},\textbf{z}$ are position vectors and have the same dimensions as $\textbf{x}$. The velocity of a particle is the resultant vector of its current velocity and the particles attraction vectors $(\textbf{y}-\textbf{x}), (\textbf{z}-\textbf{x})$, respectively, known as \textit{cognitive} and \textit{social} components of the  particle's velocity formula, as shown in Equation \ref{eqn_pso_velocity}. The attraction vectors impose force of attraction on the particle to move closer to their respective components. Thus, the next position of a particle is the resultant of its current position and its next velocity as shown in Equation (\ref{eqn_pso_position}).
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn_pso_velocity}
    \textbf{v} &\leftarrow  \omega\textbf{v} + c_1Rand()\circ(\textbf{z}-\textbf{x}) + c_2Rand()\circ(\textbf{z}-\textbf{x})\\
    \label{eqn_pso_position}
    \textbf{x} &\leftarrow \textbf{x} + \textbf{v}
\end{align}
where $\omega$ is the weight of the velocity, also known as \textit{inertia coefficient}, and controls the convergence of the algorithm, $c_1, c_2$ are acceleration coefficients and controls the weight of attraction towards the cognitive and social components, respectively, $Rand()\in U(0,1)$ is a random function, along the acceleration coefficients, is element-wise multiplied with the components to improve diversity of the search by introducing stochastic behavior.

Although PSO was originally proposed for continuous problem, it is applied to discrete problems successfully as well. In the latter case, the solutions are represented by \textit{0-1} integer variables \cite{KennedyAAlgorithm} or integer-linear by approximation to the nearest integer values \cite{Clerc2000DiscreteProblem}, which is the representation employed adopted in our problem as it is compact, hence fewer decision variables. Accordingly, after the new position (or candidate solution) is determined, following Equations \ref{eqn_pso_velocity} and \ref{eqn_pso_position}, the solution is discretized by rounding off the its elements to the nearest integer values, that is $\textbf{x}\leftarrow [\textbf{x}]$.

\subsubsection{Differential Evolution}
Similar to PSO, Differential Evolution (DE) is a population-based metaheuristic technique for the global optimization which includes non-linear and non-differentiable problems. It was initially proposed by Storn and Price in 19995 \cite{Storn1997DifferentialSpaces}, since then it has improved with regard to the different operators of DE such as mutation and crossover, and variants over population topology and hybridization \cite{Das2016RecentSurvey}. It is a parallel search technique, therefore, is ideal for computationally intensive problems, and employs mutation and crossover operators that allow the search to skip local minima as opposed to PSO.

In every generation, the population undergoes mutation, crossover, and selection according to the formulas shown in Equation , (\ref{eqn_de_crossover}), and (\ref{eqn_de_selection}), respectively. A mutant vector $v$ is created from randomly selected elements $\{a,b,c\}\in PN$ according the mutation operation shown in Equation (\ref{eqn_de_mutation}), that is by adding the base matrix to the weighted difference matrix $F\circ(b-c)$, where $F$ controls the amplification of the $(\textbf{b}-\textbf{c})$ variation.
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn_de_mutation}
    \textbf{v} & \leftarrow   \textbf{a} + F\circ(\textbf{b}-\textbf{c})\\
    \label{eqn_de_crossover}
    u_{ik} & \leftarrow 
    \begin{cases}
    v_{ik} & \mbox{if } U(0,1) \leq CF \mbox{ and } h = (i*K+k)\\
    x_{ik} & \mbox{if } U(0,1) > CF \mbox{ and } h \neq (i*K+j)
    \end{cases}\\
    \label{eqn_de_selection}
    \textbf{x} &\leftarrow 
    \begin{cases}
    \textbf{u} & \mbox{if } f(\textbf{u}) < f(\textbf{x})\mbox{ functions}\\
    \textbf{x} & \mbox{otherwise }
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization}
The canonical PSO technique uses the constriction factors to balance exploitation and exploration of the search space, that is to deliver better quality solutions. Nevertheless, it still suffers from local minima especially for complex and large problems that exhibit especially multimodal behavior. Hybridization of PSO is one the most widely studied approach in the improvement of the the PSO technique. Basically, it combines other optimization techniques, for instance to intensify local search, and improve diversification by introducing stochastic search. However, hybridization of PSO usually incurs additional computation time. Therefore, the benefit of hybridization has to be studied carefully in conjunction to computation time. Moreover, it should not complicate the user-configurable parameters, to be inline with the philosophy of PSO for ease-of-use.

PSO is hybridized with several optimization techniques, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), DE, local searches (e.g., Hill-climbing, gradient decent, etc.), ant colony, simulated annealing, etc. Of which, it is shown to perform better when hybridized with DE on constrained, discrete, large benchmarks. Furthermore, it is shown to perform better when hybridized with Hill-climbing (specifically \textit{Steepest-descent} variant)for software allocation problem \cite{} in particular. In this paper, we hybridize PSO with DE (DEPSO) and Hill-climbing (HCPSO) to the solve the software allocation problem as formulated in Equation (x). In the latter case, we also apply the stochastic variant of Hill-climbing (SHPSO) in order to offset stagnation of the steepest Hill-climbing when applied on large software allocation problems.

\subsubsection{Differential Evolution PSO (DEPSO)}
DE complements the classical PSO by introducing stochastic behavior via the evolutionary operators such as mutation, cross-over and selection. In this specific hybridization approach, we allow the DE algorithm to run intermittently for some number of generations before the next PSO generation starts.

\subsubsection{Hill-climbing PSO}
Hill-climbing is a popular local search based on the notion of \textit{neighborhood}, that is, the candidate solution (or neighbor) that performs better is selected iteratively until no improvements can be made. The software allocation solution $\textbf{x}$ is neighbor to $\textbf{x\textquotesingle}$ if $\textbf{x}=\textbf{x\textquotesingle}$ except $\exists i,j|\;x_{ij}\neq x\textquotesingle_{ij}$, that is, a single mapping is different. In every iteration, the best neighbor is selected, and subsequently replaces the current candidate solution if it performs better, and continues until maximum iteration, this variant is known as Steepest-descent Hill-climbing (SHC).

Since SHC exhaustively checks all neighbors before moving to the next iteration, the computation time is high especially for high-dimensional problems. To offset this problem, we also apply the stochastic version of Hill-climbing. In the later case, the neighbor is selected randomly, first by selecting the dimension, that is the component $c_{ij}$, where $i=U(1,I)$ and $j=U(1,K)$, second, selecting the value, that is the node $n_j$, where $j=U(1,J)$. If the neighbor improves the current candidate solution sufficiently, the search moves to the next iteration, which is until no more improvements can be made.
