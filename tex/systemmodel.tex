\subsection{Software Applications}
A software application represents an independent and self-contained user-defined software functionality, e.g., x-by-wire, electronic throttle control, flight control, etc. In AUTOSAR, software applications are developed using AUTOSAR \textit{Software Component} (SW-C), which is design-time concept that represents the lowest-level hierarchical element in software architecture of the software application, hence is atomic, and therefore is mapped to a single computing unit. It is implented by the AUTOSAR runnables, which are schedulable pieces of codes (or objects), and contains specifications of timing behavior and computation resources needed by the runnables. We formally represent the AUTOSAR software application as follows:
\begin{definition}[AUTOSAR Software Application]\footnote{ Note: only relevant concepts of the official AUTOSAR software application definition is assumed to avoid unnecessary complexity. }\label{def_application}
	We represent it as a \textit{directed acyclic vertex-weighted} graph $\langle V, L, w\rangle$ of periodic runnables, where $V$ denotes runnable nodes, $a_{ij}\in L$ a data-dependency link from $r_i$ to $r_j$, where $i \neq j$. The assignment function $w: V\rightarrow (\mathrm{E}_i\mathrm{,D,P, N})$ sets each runnable nodes the computation cost such as worst-case execution times (WCET) $\mathrm{E=\{E}_h:h=1,...,n_N\}$, deadline D and period P, where $\mathrm{E}_h\in \mathrm{E}$ is the WCET of $r$ on the computing unit $n_h\in N$.
\end{definition}

A path in the graph $\ssb{\Gamma}[l]=\ssb{r}\rightarrow,...,\rightarrow,\ssb{r}[j]$ represents a \textit{cause-effect} chain, where $\ssb{r},\ssb{r}[j]\in \mathcal{V}(\ar)$ are source and sink of the chain, e.g., consider the example from Figure the appication \ttar[1] in Figure~ \ref{fig_dag_runnables}, $\ssb{r}[1]\rightarrow \ssb{r}[3]\rightarrow \ssb{r}[5]$ is the chain, and $\ssb{r}[1],\ssb{r}[5]$, respectively are the source and the sink of the chain. A chain is a subfunctionality of the application that is triggered by a stimulus (or stimuli), e.g., pressing a brake pedal, and the corresponding response, e.g.,  vehicle braking to the desired speed level. It usually has a user-defined timing requirement, known as \textit{end-to-end} timing requirement (EE), which puts an upper-bound on the duration between the stimulus and the corresponding response of executing the chain. The set of chains are represented as \ttsexp{\Gamma}{\Gamma}. Note:  each runnable is subscribes to at least one chain.

\subsection{Scheduling Software Applications}
We assume software applications share the execution platform such as the computing units and the on-board network bus, following the mixed-criticality design~\cite{Vestal2007PreemptiveAssurance}. Thus, software applications with different software criticality should be isolated in order to prevent interference of lower-criticality applications on higher-critical applications. Assume the braking functionality of a vehicle, which is safety-criticality, is distributed over multiple computing units. Another application with infotainment functionality also shares the units. The mixed-criticality design to this problem ensures both applications are schedulable during absence of errors, however, the braking application must also be schedulable in cases of overrun due to errors, e.g., by degrading or halting the infotainment application. There are several techniques in the literature that deal with the scheduling of mixed-criticality applications on \textit{uniprocessor} systems \cite{Vestal2007PreemptiveAssurance}. In this work, we consider the \textit{partitioned criticality (PA)} (or criticality-as-priority assignment, CAPA) technique to schedule the mixed-criticality applications, which prioritizes applications based on criticality, rather than \textit{deadline} as used by the deadline monotoic assignment \cite{Baruah2011Response-timeSystems}. In contrast to other techniques, CAPA is easy to implement and does not require a runtime monitoring, e.g., using servers \cite{AbeniIntegratingSystems,Ashjaei2017DesigningSystems,Inam2014ThePlatforms}, though not efficient\footnote{Note: scheduling techniques other than the PA technique can be used with our approach to schedule the applications.}. Thus, the software  applications are schedulable according to CAPA if the runnables, messages, and chains in the of the applications are schedulable, that is, they meet their corresponding deadlines. 

According to AUTOSAR~\cite{AUTOSAR2017SpecificationSoftware}, runnables are high-level schedulable objects that are mapped to tasks, and subsequently are scheduled by the AUTOSAR operating system \cite{AUTOSAR2018Specification4.2.2}. Next, we explain the mapping rules applied in this work.

\subsubsection{Runnables-to-Tasks Mapping/Transformation}\label{subsec_runnables-to-tasks}
In the mapping process, one or more runnables can be merged to optimize the runtime execution by reducing the number of tasks scheduled by the OS. In this work, we merge the runnables $a,b\in \gr{V}{\ar}$ into the task $v\in \gr{V}{\at}$ if the following two conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item $(a,b)\in \mathcal{E}(\ar)$ is a link in the graph,
	\item the period of $a$ is a factor of $b$, or vice versa
\end{enumerate*}
, otherwise, each runnable is mapped to a separate task, inheriting the timing specifications of the runnable.
If the merging conditions are met, the timing specifications of $v$ are set as follows: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item the WCET of the task is set to the sum of the WCET of the runnables, i.e., E$_h^v=$E$_h^a + $E$_h^b$, for all $h:1,...,n_N$,
	\item the period and deadline of the task is set to the minimum of the runnables' periods, P$_v$=D$_v=min($P$_a, $P$_b)$
\end{enumerate*}

The AUTOSAR software applications is shedulable if and only if its task graph is scheduable, that is each task node meets its deadline, each communication between task nodes (that is, the message) meets its deadline, and the chain meets end-to-end requirement. The schedulability analysis of the tasks, messages and chains used in this work are explained next.

\subsubsection{Scheduling of Tasks and Messages}\label{subsec_response-time_analysis}
Following the CAPA scheduling technique, the tasks in the distributed system are assigned priorities according to their criticality, thus the higher the application's criticaity, the higher the priority its tasks acquire
\[
cri(b_i)>cri(b_j)\implies \forall \tau_1,\in V(b_i)\forall \tau_2\in V(b_j)\ Pri(\tau_1)>Pri(\tau_2),
\]
where $\forall i,j:1,...,n_A\land i\neq j$, $cri$ and $pri$ are predicates which detemine the critiality and priority of tasks $\tau_1,\tau_2$, respectively; $\mathcal{V}(b_i), \mathcal{V}(b_j)$ returns the tasks of $b_i$ and $a_j$, respectively.

The tasks are scheduled using the \textit{fixed-priority preemptive scheduling policy} (FPPS)~\cite{Sha2004RealPerspective}, and the schedulability analysis, that is the necessary and sufficiency testing for schedulability, is conducted via the classical response-time analysis (RTA) as shown by Equation~(\ref{eqn_responsetimeanalysis}) \cite{Baruah2011Response-timeSystems,Baruah2011Response-timeSystems}. According to the analysis, if the response time of a task is less than or equal to its deadline, that tasks a $\delta_\tau\leq Deadline_\tau$, the task is schedulable, otherwise not. 

\begin{align}
\label{eqn_responsetimeanalysis}
R_\tau=C_\tau+\sum_{j\in h\!p(\tau)}
{
	\ceil[\Big]
	{
		\frac{R_\tau}{P_j}
	}C_j
},
\end{align}
where $C_\tau,C_j$ are exection times of the lower and higher priority tasks, respectivel; $h\!p(\tau)$ is the predicate that returns the higher-priority tasks of task $c_\tau$.

The messages in the CAN bus are scheduled using a fixed, non-preemptive scheduling policy. Similar to the tasks, the priority of messages follows the CAPA technique to achieve the mixed-criticality requirement. This can easily be achived by inheriting the priority of each sender task communicating over the bus $pri(m)$ to the successor message $suc(\tau)$, that is $pri(m)=pri(\tau)|\tau = suc(m)$. The schdulability of messages is checked using the classical response-time analysis of the CAN network using Equation~(\ref{eqn_responsetimeanalysisCAN}), as presented by Rob Davis et. al~\cite{Davis2007ControllerRevised}. The worst-case response time of a message is computed as the sum of its \textit{jitter} time (that is, the time  taken by the sender task to queue for transmittion) $J_m$, the \textit{interference} time (that is, the message delay in the queue) $w_m$, and its \textit{transmission} time  (that is, the longest time for a signal or data to be transmitted) $c_m$.
\begin{align}
\label{eqn_responsetimeanalysisCAN}
R_m&=J_m+w_m+c_m\\
\label{eqn_interference}
w_m&=B_m+
\sum_{\forall k\in hp(m)}
{
	\ceil[\Big]
	{
		\frac{w_m+\tau_{bit}}{P_k}
	}c_k
}\\
\label{eqn_iblocking}
B_m&=\max_{\forall k\in lp(m)}(c_k),
\end{align}

Note: we assume no jitter, therefore, the interferenece formula is reduced as shown in Equation (\ref{eqn_interference}), where $B_m$ is the blocking time caused by the lower-priority messages using the CAN bus (since it is non-preemptive) and is computed by Equation (\ref{eqn_iblocking}); $hp(m)$ finds the higher-priority messages, which delay the trasmission of the message $m$ in the queue and in the transmission.

\subsubsection{Scheduling Cause-effect Chains}\label{subsec_cause-effect_chains}
The chain consists of indpendently clocked tasks, which results in undersampling/oversampling effects. As a result, a single propagating across the chain is characterized by having various delays, which are discussed in detail by Feiertag et al.~\cite{Feiertag2009ASemantics} in the context of single-register buffer communication,  which is a common practice in control systems design, e.g., automotive software applications~\cite{Becker2017End-to-endSystems}. In this work, we demonstrate the two widely used semantics in the automotive domain: \textit{age} delay and \textit{reaction} dealy, and consider only the age delay in the analysis. The age delay is the time elapsed between the data arriving a the input register (which is the stimulus) and its corresponding latest, non-overwritten output at the output register {\sffamily OR} (which is the response). And, the reaction delay is the earliest time the system takes to respond to a stimulus that ``just missed" the read access at the input of the chain.

Consider the chain $\tau_1\rightarrow \tau_2\rightarrow \tau_4$ of the task graph from Figure~\ref{fig_dag_runnables}, and assume it is mapped on the computing units $n_1$ and $n_2$ as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig_cause_effect_chain}, and communicate using the single-register buffers. The tasks $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ execute on node $n_1$, whereas task $\tau_3$ executes on node $n_2$. The input data can arrive at any instance in the input register {\sffamily IR}. 
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/cause_effect_chain_ntk}
	\caption{A Cause-effect Chain, mapped on nodes $n_1$ and $n_2$.}
	\label{fig_cause_effect_chain}
\end{figure}

The execution behavior of the chain is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig_timedchainntk} over two hyper-periods.  Note:  the message between $\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ is not shown in the figure for simplicity. The red inverted arrows in the figure represent the reading of data from the input register, whereas the dashed-curve arrows represent the timed paths through which the data propagates from the input to the output of the chain. Thus, the age delay is the time elapsed between the $3^{rd}$ instance of  $\tau_1$  and the $10^{th}$ instance of $\tau_3$. It is frequently used in the control systems where freshness of data is paramount, e.g., braking a car over a bounded time. Assume that data arrives just after the start of the $1^{st}$ instance of $\tau_1$ execution. The data corresponding to this event is not read by the current instance of $\tau_1$. In fact, the data will be read by the $2^{nd}$ instance of $\tau_1$. The earliest effect of this data at the output of the chain will appear at the $7^{th}$ instance of $\tau_3$, which represents the reaction delay. This delay is useful in the body-electronics domain where first reaction to events is important, e.g., in the button-to-reaction applications. For detailed discussion of the different delay semantics, we direct the reader to check research work by Mubeen et al.~\cite{mubeen2013support}. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{img/timedchain_ntk}
	\caption{Reaction and Age Delays of the Cause-effect Chain, Shown in Figure {\ref{fig_causeeffectchainntk}}.}
	\label{fig_timedchainntk}
\end{figure}

Thus, if the chain is mapped to a single computing unit, the age delay  $\Delta^{sub}$ is computed using Equation (\ref{eqn_agedelay_singlenode}), that is by taking the difference between the activations of the sink and the source taks, plus the response-time of the sink task. Otherwise, if it is mapped to multiple units and the bus, the delay $\Delta$ is computed compositionally by identifying the subchains using Equation (\ref{eqn_agedelay_multinode}). In the latter case, the response-time of messages $\delta^{msg}$, and the ``just missed'' case that is by adding the period of the successor task $P_{suc(j)}$ are  taken into consideration. 
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn_agedelay_singlenode}
	\Delta^{sub}(\gamma) &= \alpha(sin(\gamma))-\alpha(src(\gamma)) + \delta(sink(\gamma)) & \text{single unit}\\
	\label{eqn_agedelay_multinode}
	\Delta(\gamma)&=\sum_{i\in I_{\gamma}}{\Delta^{sub}(i)} + \sum_{j\in  J_{\gamma}}{[\delta^{msg}(j)+P_{suc(j)}]}, &\text{muliple units}
\end{align}
where $\alpha(\tau)$ computes the activation of the task $\tau$, based on the age-delay semanics.

%Assume $\Gamma \in \ssp{\Gamma}$ is a chain, if the chain is mapped on a single computing unit, the age delay is a mere difference between the activation of the sink task $\ssb{\alpha}[\tau_j]$ and the activation of the source task $\ssb{\alpha}[\tau_i]$ plus the worst-case response time of the sink task $\ssb{\delta}[\tau_j]$ in the longest timed path according to the semantics of the age delay. On the other hand, if the chain is mapped to multiple nodes, the age delay $\Delta_{multi}$ can be compositionally computed~\cite{Feiertag2009ASemantics} as follows: the chain is partitioned  into a set of sub-chains per node, indicated by the predicate $subch(\Gamma)$, and for each sub-chain $a\in subch(\Gamma)$, the age delay is computed recursively using the same method to used to compute the age delay for a single node, and the result is added to the response-times of the messages involved in the chain, $msg(\Gamma)$.

\subsection{Reliability of Software Applications}\label{sub_reliability}
In this context, \textit{software application reliability} refers to the probability that a software application functions correctly by the time $t$, or within the time interval $[0, t]$ \cite{Goel1985SoftwareApplicability}. Redundancy is the most common way for implementing fault tolerance and increasing the reliability of a system. Redundancy can be implemented according to different schemes, such as hot stand-by, cold stand-by, etc.~\cite{Dubrova2013Fault-tolerantDesign}, which differ on the number of replicas that are active as well as the methods for detection and compensation of faulty replicas. In our system model, we consider the hot-standby scheme, where replicated components maintain the same state, but only one replica (the so-called \textit{primary}) effectively acts on the environment, for instance issuing an input. The primary software component will be denoted as \ttssb{q}[i,1], whereas the secondary software component, which is in the stand-by, by \ttssb{q}[i,2], etc., for a software application $A_k$.

%Note: the software components are replicated unless the reliability requirements of applications are satisfied.


In this work the details of the redundancy scheme are abstracted away under the following assumptions:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Software does not contain design errors. This has two implications: first, that hardware elements, i.e. computing nodes and communication buses, are the only causes of failure and, second, that introduction of N-version programming is not required. Different replicas of the same software component execute exactly the same program.
	\item Hot stand-by redundancy (also known as Primary/backup) is used for detection and replacement of failed components.
	\item Software components need to be replicated only if the application's reliability requirement is not met without replication, otherwise they are not replicated.
	\item The time needed to detect and replace a faulty component is considered negligible and will not be taken into account in the response time analysis of tasks and delay calculation of cause-effect chains;
	\item Because of its simplicity, the mechanism for detection and replacement of faulty components will be considered fault-free, and therefore will not be included in the reliability calculations
\end{enumerate*}

Note that under these assumptions, the reliability of a software application is equivalent to the reliability of the platform on which it is deployed. The reliability of a computing unit (and of the bus) can be easily calculated as $e^{\lambda t}$, where $\lambda$ is an exponentially distributed failure-rate. However, calculating the reliability of the whole execution platform is not trivial for the case with replication. In particular, the traditional series-parallel reliability approach cannot be applied because of the \textit{functional} interdependencies created between computing nodes as the result of replication and allocation. To illustrate the difficulty, let us assume a software application $A_k$, having  component configurations with and without replication as shown Table \ref{fig_depwr} and \ref{fig_depwor}, respectively, where $\ssb{q}[i,j]$ is the $j^{th}$ software-component replica of software-component type $\ssb{c}\in \ssb{C}$. Note: for readability of the example, we remove the superscript $k$.

\end{figure}

The reliability of the software application without replication forms a series path, indicated by the reliability block diagram (RBD) of Figure~\ref{fig_rbd}a, hence is computed as products of the reliability of $n_1,n_2$ and $B$. However, with replication, two computing nodes can form as series and parallel to service the software application,  e.g., due to \ttssb{q}[1,1] and \ttssb{q}[2,2] or \ttssb{q}[3,2], $n_1$ and $n_3$ make series, and due to \ttssb{q}[3,1] and \ttssb{q}[3,2], the nodes make parallel, to realize a partial functionality of the application. In this case, the series-parallel diagram depicted in Figure~\ref{fig_rbd}b does not accurately capture the reliability calculation of the application with replication. Note: the red-dashed line between $n_1$ and $n_3$ indicates the possibility of the computing nodes becoming series. To overcome this problem, we will use an exact technique for reliability calculation based on the enumeration of the different failure states of the computing nodes; that is, the different failure states of the execution platform are enumerated exhaustively, and subsequently, the total probability the software application functions is computed. This technique will be discussed in great length in Subsection~\ref{subsec_reliability_constraint}.
