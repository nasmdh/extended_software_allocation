\begin{abstract}
The growing complexity of automotive functionality has attracted revolutionary computing architectures such as mixed-criticality design, which enables effective consolidation of software applications with different criticality on shared execution platforms. The allocation of mixed-critical software application on the execution platform plays an important role in the design of predictable and resource-constrained real-time software systems that are required to meet end-to-end timing and reliability requirements, and preserve critical system resources such as  power and energy of embedded systems.  Due to the non-linearity of real-time scheduling, complexity of reliability analysis, and large-scale software systems, exact methods, e.g., branch and bound, are prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid particle-swarm optimization technique for integrated software allocation on heterogeneous computing units to optimize total power consumption while meeting end-to-end timing and reliability requirements. Our optimization approach takes into consideration fault-tolerance to maximize reliability of software applications to meet reliability goals. To reduce the overhead of fault-tolerance especially on end-to-end timing analysis, we propose an approximation technique. The proposed approach is evaluated using a range of different software applications that are synthesized from a real-world automotive benchmark. The evaluation makes comparative analysis of integer-linear programming method and various hybrid algorithms on metrics such as optimality, efficiency and scalability.
